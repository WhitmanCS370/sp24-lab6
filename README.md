Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?

we both understood the chapter and understand closures to be basically private varaiables.



* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

seems like classes with extra steps, why do that?


* description of func.py

This is just and extension of the interpretation system we looked at last time. This time however, you can create seperate environemnts instead of everything being one global environment. It also implements the definition and calling of function. 



Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
