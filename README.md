## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?
The first part of the chapter talked about how functions are just dat aand conventions in calling them. Further it talked about 
preventing naming collisions and creating new environments for functions. The other half talked about creating private data by 
creating functions inside functions which creates closure. 

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
It was easy to understand the main ideas of things explained in the chapter but it was confusing as to why we are implementing 
these things in the way they are talked about and how to actually implement them.

Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
